The **first field** in this row is responsible for the **name which is displayed on hover**:

The **second field** indicates the **path** to the file which has to be opened:

And the **third field** is a name of an **icon** which will be displayed on Ribbon actions (select it from [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev/), but be aware that not all the icons from there are available in Obsidian). It is optional to fill (default icon is "file"):
